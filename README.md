**CPMHA Intern Organizer/Manager**
<br> <br>
An app I built during my remote summer 2020 internship for Concussions, Pain, Mental Health Awareness ([cpmha.com](http://cpmha.com/)). The purpose of the web app is to manage interns, announcements, tasks, teams, events, work hours, and essentially all the inner workings of any small company. I built this in about 3 weeks' time, and deployed it for use and presented it to the company on August 20, 2020. Features include assigning tasks to specific intern(s) and team(s), logging hours, adding/editing/deleting anything and everything with master controls, and a sleek, easy-to-use interface.
